# Quelea

Here lies the repository for the main Quelea project. This is where the code lives - if you're just interesting in downloading / using Quelea, then see the main site at https://quelea.org.

You can see the latest nightly releases [here](https://quelea.org/nightly/job/Quelea/ws/Quelea/dist/standalone/). These are automatically built from this repository, so should not be used in production settings.

Better README.md to follow. This is just a stub for now.
