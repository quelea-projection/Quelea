# Translations

This directory contains Quelea's translation files. If you can speak another language and want to contribute (either updating an existing translation or creating a new one), then please see here for instructions:

https://quelea.org/lang/

The above link is dynamically updated with any missing labels, and we'll gladly accept PR's that fix any gaps in translations. New translations are very welcome too, but they'll only be accepted if they're at least mostly complete.

*Note: The only exceptions to the above are the `gb.lang` and `us.lang` files. The former is the master file we use for labels, and `us.lang` is automatically generated from it with a few spelling alterations. If you spot a mistake in either of these files, please create an issue rather than submitting a PR - we may need to deal with it in the code.*
