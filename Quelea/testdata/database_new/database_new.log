Verse one considers how we respond first and foremost to the cross, coming into the Kingdom of Christ and seeking to praise Him. Verse two was inspired by the Sermon on the Mount, where Christ teaches what it means to be children of the Kingdom - loving righteousness and justice, walking in humility, with mercy and letting His light shine through us. Verse three reminds us of our call to declare the Gospel and the Kingdom to the lost. The chorus is our response to follow and ultimately, in all we do - helping the sick, feeding the hungry, working for justice, explaining the faith - our aim is to proclaim salvation in Jesus'' name''.\u000a\u000aHEAR THE CALL OF THE KINGDOM\u000aLift your eyes to the King\u000aLet His song rise within you\u000aAs a fragrant offering\u000aOf how God rich in mercy\u000aCame in Christ to redeem\u000aAll who trust in His unfailing grace\u000a\u000aHear the call of the Kingdom\u000aTo be children of light\u000aWith the mercy of heaven\u000aThe humility of Christ\u000aWalking justly before Him\u000aLoving all that is right\u000aThat the life of Christ may shine through us\u000a\u000aKing of Heaven we will answer the call\u000aWe will follow bringing hope to the world\u000aFilled with passion filled with power to proclaim\u000aSalvation in Jesus'' name\u000a\u000aHear the call of the Kingdom\u000aTo reach out to the lost\u000aWith the Father''s compassion\u000aIn the wonder of the cross\u000aBringing peace and forgiveness\u000aAnd a hope yet to come\u000aLet the nations put their trust in Him','','Hear the call of the Kingdom','',630)
