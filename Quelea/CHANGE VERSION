When changing the version number, it needs to be changed in :

1) pad.xml
2) quelea.properties (ant task uses this so must be changed.)
3) Version constant in QueleaProperties.java (remember the minor version constant as the second argument if this is an Alpha / Beta / another dev release.)
4) quelea.desktop
5) Control file for debian based installs
6) MyAppVersion in quelea.iss
7) MyAppVersion in quelea64.iss
8) launch4j/config.xml
9) (Potentially) update getMinorName() in Version.java

This should probably all be automated at some point!

Remember changelogs need to go in changelogs/ folder as .gz files WITH MAXIMUM
COMPRESSION ("gzip -9"). Otherwise deb package gets a lintian warning.
