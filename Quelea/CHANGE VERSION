When changing the version number, it needs to be changed in :

1) pad.xml
2) quelea.properties (ant task uses this so must be changed.)
3) Version constant in QueleaProperties.java
4) quelea.desktop
5) Control file for debian based installs
6) MyAppVersion in quelea.iss

This should probably all be automated at some point!
