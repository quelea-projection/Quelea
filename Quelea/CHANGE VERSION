When changing the version number, it needs to be changed in:

1) Version constant in QueleaProperties.java (remember the minor version constant as the second argument if this is an Alpha / Beta / another dev release.)
2) gradle.properties
3) snap/snapcraft.yaml
4) Add a <release> tag to releases in flatpak/org.quelea.Quelea.metainfo.xml (Linux metainfo)

Everything else should now be automated.

When releasing, change links on http://quelea.org/download
